# UZR - Universal Realtime Zone

Have the best of both worlds.

Standard daylight saving times (DST) give some more sunshine time in the summer during the evening when most people can use it - rather than very early in the morning. But in order to achieve that, the clock gets advanced a full hour usually around the end of March. This can make it difficult to start the next day due to an hour of sleep time lost.

With UZR, the clock is gradually advanced two minutes each day for 30 days. Noone will miss or even notice two minutes of the day, but by the end of March, UZR and the usual DST will have aligned, keeping the bonus of another hour of sunlight in the evening.

The setback at the end of October is kept as is it, allowing for another hour of sleep.
